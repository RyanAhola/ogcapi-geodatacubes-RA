# OGC GeoDataCube SWG


In a very agile approach, this Standards Working Group (SWG) has the goal to facilitate the handling of different GeoDataCubes (GDCs). For this purpose, an Application Programming Interface (API) will be defined that serves the core functionalities of GeoDataCubes. GDC users will be able to handle different GeoDataCubes according to the same principles, as interoperability between GDCs will be achieved.

The GeoDataCube SWG will define a metadata model including provenance and data lineage information to describe all details about a GeoDataCube. Furthermore, the SWG will identify formats to be used for data exchange. If existing formats do not meet the requirements, the SWG will extend its work to the development of a GeoDataCube exchange format.

The OGC GeoDataCubes Standards Working Group (SWG) is the group at OGC responsible for the stewardship of the standard, but is working to do as much work in public as possible.

It is required that the standard is supported by implementation evidence, so proposals and issues should preferably be made with reference to an implementation and outcomes of regression tests for any test cases defined for the standard.
